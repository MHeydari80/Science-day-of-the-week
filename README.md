# Science-day-of-the-week

(Zellerâ€™s congruence is an algorithm developed by Christian Zeller to calculate the day of the week. The formula is
 h=(q + 26 (m + 1) / 10 + k + k / 4 + j / 4 + 5j)%7).

This program prompts the user to enter a year, month, and day of the month, and  displays the name of the day of the week.
Here are some sample runs:
